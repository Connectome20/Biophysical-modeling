# Biophysical-modeling

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for performing axon diameter mapping and SANDI (Soma and Neurite Density Imaging) analysis based on high-gradient diffusion MRI data acquired using the 3T Connectome 2.0 scanner, as developed in [Gabriel Ramos-Llorden, Hong-Hsi Lee, ..., Susie Y Huang, Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2025](in press)().

## Scripts
* **A1_TractCaliber.m** - Axon diameter mapping using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods
* **A2_SANDI_analysis.m** - SANDI model fitting using random forest regression

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2019b or later
- [SANDI-Matlab-Toolbox v1.0](https://github.com/palombom/SANDI-Matlab-Toolbox-v1.0) (must be installed and added to the MATLAB path)
